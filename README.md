# 👋 Hello, I'm Shravani Ankur Wanjari
Currently pursuing Computer Science Engineering for my B. Tech degree. My interests include Cybersecurity and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In Cybersecurity, I enjoy learning about testing systems for vulnerabilities. My HCI focus is on researching because working on the edge of knowledge and finding out how to make things work better for user is a very intriguing thing for me.
