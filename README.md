# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Shravani Ankur Wanjari  

Finished my third year of Btech CSE. Working on a bunch of projects some involving research while others being applications in the quant finance.

# Projects
While I have worked on multiple projects, I dont think there was much learning that took place due to âœ¨'vibe coding'âœ¨, so I will mention my actual projects once I am confident about them.

# Experience
- one useless experience of UI Design Internship. Only thing useful I learnt was how to not be sarcastic when your supervisor is being annoying.
- Research Intern at my university's AI Research Center where vibe coding got me an accepted paper at an IEEE conference in a field I never really want to work on again (eeg signalsðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)


# Let's Connect
Lets not.
