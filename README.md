## 📌 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at **Woxsen University**, graduating in **2026**.  
My core academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of **AI/ML** and **Quant Finance**, supported by a strong mathematical foundation.

As a **Research Intern** at the AI Research Centre, Woxsen University, I contributed to the paper  
**“XGBoost-based Emotion Classification in Healthcare Using Electroencephalogram Signals”**, accepted at **IEEE CAI 2025**.  
This project involved applying machine learning to complex EEG datasets and achieved **86.9% accuracy**, outperforming traditional methods like **SVM** and **ANN**.

My technical toolkit includes **Python, C++, and R**. I also have hands-on experience with infrastructure and deployment tools such as **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **FastAPI**, and **AWS**.

I'm currently developing an **Autonomous Explainable AI (XAI) Agent for Financial Market Intelligence**,  
designed to deliver intelligent and transparent market insights.
